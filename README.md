# modifying wallpapers
it's pretty much straightforward, so i don't think i need to explain how to modify them. (if you know how to work with image editors, ofc)

# color banding
yes, i know. some of my wallpapers have color banding.

if you know how to fix color banding, say how by creating an issue with label "enhancement"
